# Bank_loan_Analysis

Monitoring and evaluating key performance indicators (KPIs) pertaining to loan applications and disbursements are part of this Analytics Project. Average Interest Rate, Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI), Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received are among the KPIs. In order to give information about the performance of the loan portfolio and the financial stability of the borrowers, each indicator is tracked on a month-to-date (MTD) and month-over-month (MoM) basis.

The project has distinct KPIs for each category to distinguish between good and bad loans. To facilitate data-driven decision-making, a complete Loan Status Grid View is developed to classify and report on these parameters.
